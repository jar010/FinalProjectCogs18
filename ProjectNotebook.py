# # Project Description

# FINISH THE LYRICS QUIZ: My project idea consisted of making a simple, yet fun quiz that focused on songs I am primarily enjoying right now. They are a total of ten songs where the player taking this quiz-- or more like a game, has to guess the next song lyric. I included a few easy and predictable ones, but also a few challenging questions. This quiz is all multiple choice and once entered, you are shown if you have gotten it right or wrong, and lastly your overall percentage at the end! 

# ## Project Code

# If it makes sense for your project, you can have code and outputs here in the notebook as well.

# #### Extra Credit (*optional*)
#  
# 1. I came in with absolutely zero coding experience. Everytime I heard about coding, I was intimidated because it seemed like only people who are heavily stem interested can achieve coding, but within the 10 weeks in this class, I learned even beginners can quickly learn and have fun, just as I did in this class.
# 2. Although this project took 10+ hours to complete, I did have fun doing it and learned there is so much that coding can do as tedious as it can be. I achieved a quiz that included music I liked and overall learned a lot about being patient with your code and teaching yourself as well because knowledge is a great resource when learning something difficult.
